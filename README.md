Playground repo to explore AI + realtime sound generation

## Project Planning

### Objectives

- Take an
- Ultimately
  - Provide a playground in which I can play with realtime AI music generation
  - Provide a God-like experience of creating amazing music in realtime
  - Have tons of fun coding with amazing technologies and fun languages
- Right now
  - Milestones
    1. When you press a button, the browser plays a sound
       a. I get the sound from the browswer
    2. The browser plays a for on the floor beat
    3. The browser synthesizes sound using a voice-to-text model
    4. The ability to do (3) on a beat
    5. The ability to add some kind of effect to the voice
  - Basic ability to k

### Tech Stack

- **Client** : Browser

  - **UI** : SolidJS (I guess?)
  - **State** :

- **Server** : Rust / Something else <- Maybe Python for now
  - Sound file serving
  - Oh wait.. I hava a javascript server already
    - should I turn that into a Python server?

### Todo

- [ ] Basic learning.. do 1 hr of learning SolidJS
  - [x] Build a simple counter app
  - [ ] Do a test with this context thing?
    - Two counters with renderers and increment buttons
  - [ ] Do a test with this state thing
    - Two counters with renderers and increment buttons, but with state?
- [x] Lunch? :)
- [ ] Figure Investigate ToneJS
  - [ ] When you press a button, the browser plays a sound
    - [ ] I get the sound from the browser

2. The browser plays a for on the floor beat
3. The browser synthesizes sound using a voice-to-text model
4. The ability to do (3) on a beat
5. The ability to add some kind of effect to the voice

#### When feeling bored

- [ ] Lunch ;)
- [ ] Finish weekly planning
- [ ] Strategic thinking for this project
  - What are the magical moments that are key to this technology
  - What are the greatest technical hurdles that I should be able to overcome

#### Observations

- Honestly, SolidJS is like a more compicated React
  - ...and probably in ways that don't matter to much to me
  - OTOH, I like how it's built out of pure, basic typescript idioms
    - ...and doesn't have a compiler or anything fancy like that

## Usage

```bash
$ npm install # or pnpm install or yarn install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Deployment

You can deploy the `dist` folder to any static host provider (netlify, surge, now, etc.)

## Acknowledgements

This project was created with the [Solid CLI](https://solid-cli.netlify.app)
