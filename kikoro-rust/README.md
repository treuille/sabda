# Kokoro (Rust)

This is a simple command-line script which takes a sentence and runs the Kokoro model.

## Todo

### Milestone 1 (Can I get the neural net loaded as a separate project?)

- Copy the correct onnx file over
    - ...and maybe that's a good place to leave things

- Sort the following
    - [ ] Can I printf some kind of version information?
    - [ ] Can I in principle load in that model
    - [ ] Can I run it quickly

### Milestone 2 (an I outpuf a wav file based on command line arguments?)

- ???
